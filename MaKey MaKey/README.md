Arduino Updates:
- Added rainbow loop when no serial data is detected
- Changed initialization to R / G / B color wipe
- Added a button reset to loop (fixes buttons left on when exiting processing)

TODO:
- Figure out big lag when "waking" from rainbow loop when serial is detected (use interrupts?)

**Objective**: Build an uber kid-friendly monome (a complex electronic music instrument).
<hr>

**Simple**: all the files you need to build a very, very simple MaKey MaKey Monome that integrates with Scratch - a visual programming language for kids.

**Complete**: all the files you need to build an RBG LED backlit touchscreen MaKey MaKey Monome that interfaces with Processing - an elegant, complex visual programming language.
