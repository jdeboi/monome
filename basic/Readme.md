**Overview**: This  

**Installation**:
1. Install the Arduino IDE if you haven't already.
2. Install the [Sparkfun MaKey MaKey addon](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/makey-makey-advanced-guide/installing-the-arduino-addon) in order to upload Arduino code to the MaKey MaKey board
3. Download, open, and upload basic_makey_makey_monome.ino to the MaKey MaKey

**Instructions**: Use alligator clips to connect the columns of copper tape (labeled 1 through 8) and the rows of copper tape (labeled a through h) to the MaKey MaKey pins specified below:<br>
* Columns
⋅⋅⋅col1 pin D1⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅col2 - pin D0⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅col3 - down arrow pad⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅4 - left arrow pad⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅5 - pin A5⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅6 - pin A4⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅7 - pin A3⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅8 - pin A2⋅⋅
<br>
Rows<br>
a - pin D5<br>
b - pin D4<br>
c - pin D3<br>
d - pin D2<br>
e - click button pad<br>
f - space button pad<br>
g - right arrow pad<br>
h - up arrow pad<br>
<br>
**Generating Sound**:<br>
Use this Scratch program to make sound with your MaKey MaKey!  
  
  
4. And another item.

⋅⋅⋅You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we'll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).

⋅⋅⋅To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅Note that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅(This is contrary to the typical GFM line break behaviour, where trailing spaces are not required.)
