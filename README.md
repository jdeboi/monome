Overview: I built an inexpensive touch-sensitive DIY monome (an array of programmable backlit buttons) using conductive paint, Adafruit Neopixel RGB LEDs, and a Makey Makey (which can be substituted with an Arduino). The software to visualize and produce music is written in Scratch (a programming language designed for kids) and Processing (a visual programming language).

Objective: Build a complex music instrument following a process that is so easy a kid could do it.
